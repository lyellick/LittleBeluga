## About

Little Beluga aka Li'l Beluga is a simple game where you move a baby beluga whale around the sea to pop bubbles. The more bubbles you pop the happier your little beluga becomes.

## Inspiration

My wife and I appreciate [Raffi Cavoukian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raffi) and his musical talent to create children's songs that are fun and wholesome. We sing Raffi songs to him while we play or when he is fussy and the song [Baby Beluga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDx9zqDpSik) always puts a smile on his face. I thought this would be a perfect piece of media to adapt for a *pretty simple* game.

## Dedication

To my wife, who has always been excited and supportive for any new hobby I find. 

To my son, who smiles at me when ever I enter a room; thats all I need buddy. 

And to our new unborn baby, whom I don't know yet, but I am sure you are cool too. `:P`
